# Building an API for an Ecommerce Website

In this project, I will use FastAPI to build an API for a ecommerce website. 
To begin, I will plan out the API. A good API starts with modeling and translating of the product requirements into a high level API design. 

The first step is to identify the participants or users of the API. The table below provides an overview of the users and their interactions with the API.
